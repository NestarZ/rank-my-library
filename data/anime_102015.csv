Which is how relationship-challenged student Yuki finds himself on a fishing trip to a tiny island with three other boys he barely knows. Well, two other boys and Haru, who claims that he's an alien. Not that constantly stewing Natsuki or mysterious Akira are any more likely as prospects for good companionship.

But there's something about fishing that makes it unlike any other pastime, and maybe that quiet sense of companionship and hopeful expectation is just what Yuki needs to start charting the unfamiliar waters of personal connections.  Or maybe it will turn out that Haru's right and they're going to have to save the entire planet.

There are lots of different kinds of fish stories, from the ""ones that got away"" to the ""best catches ever,"" but whichever way the currents of life take them, for four young men, this trip may turn out to be the biggest whopper ever!

With the female population still a minority and living in fear of the over-the-top antics of the males, Misaki Ayuzawa takes it into her own hands to reform the school and allow the girls to feel safe in the rough environment.
Training, studying and even becoming the first female student council president of the school, Misaki has gained a reputation among the male students body as an uptight boy-hating dictator and as a shining hope for the teachers and fellow female students. However, despite her tough-as-nails appearance, she secretly works part-time at a maid cafe in order to support her family. Unfortunately, her hard-earned reputation is threatened when the popular, attractive, and somewhat impassive Usui Takumi takes an interest in her after discovering her in a maid uniform after school.

War is coming...
The two powers will soon clash with one another and by military force, start killing each other.

Humanity has clearly split into two and currently there is no way these groups will once again unite. Humanity celebrates this transient time of peace as they slowly dismiss from their minds the scars their ancestors bore in the past. No one realized that with one little push their world canfall to its destruction.

Just one little spark will do. 
Preparations are steadily on its way.
Then we shall see the end to this false peace.

But, there are men who realize the approach of this inevitable war. Most of them are close to the military. Though, of course these men are well aware that they have no power to remedy this situation. For that is why they are deep in despair. Among the soldiers that I have had contact with, there were even men who were depressed when they realized the impending war. Even then, as far as the people of Shinawara City, I did not feel that any of them had any sense of danger. While in their minds, they knew that war was unavoidable but they could not help but to continue living each day as if nothing was changed. That is all I can say about that. Humanity has grown too used to this false peace.

Humanity does not go to war because they know that they possess a clear sense of justice within their troops. Also, they do not declare war because they are confident of their own victories. The reason man goes to war is simple. War exists simply because there are men who wish to wage

We just need one simple reason.
For that reason, our plans are right on track. 
There is no way of avoidance. 
I will say it once more. 
War is coming.

(Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Sosekiâs Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawaâs Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) & The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).

No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.

In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.

Kokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls ""Sensei"". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.

Run, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of ""Run, Melos!"" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.

The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.

Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the ""Buddhist Hell."" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.
